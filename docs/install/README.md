# Installation

Choose the install path that matches the tool you use.

These pages document the generated install surfaces that this source repo
maintains. Most users will follow one tool-specific page and will not need any
contributor context from the rest of the repository.

All routes use the same MCP server:

- name: `kong-konnect`
- URL: `https://us.mcp.konghq.com`
- auth: `Authorization: Bearer ${KONNECT_TOKEN}`

`KONNECT_TOKEN` is only required for MCP-backed installs. If you only install
the shared skills with `npx skills` or `gh skill`, you do not need the token.

Use [`plugins/kong-konnect/mcp.json`](../../plugins/kong-konnect/mcp.json) as
the shared checked-in MCP example.

For skill-only installs from GitHub, prefer previewing before install:

```bash
gh skill preview kong/skills gateway-plugin-datakit
```
