For tools without a first-class plugin or extension wrapper in this repo, use the shared skills plus the MCP config.

## Skills

`npx skills` and `gh skill` are both supported install paths for the shared skills in this repo.

### `npx skills`

Install the whole repo:

```bash
npx skills add kong/skills
```

Install a single skill from this repo:

```bash
npx skills add kong/skills --skill gateway-plugin-datakit
```

Update all globally installed skills:

```bash
npx skills update -g -y
```

Update one installed skill:

```bash
npx skills update -g -y gateway-plugin-datakit
```

`--skill` applies to `npx skills add`. The `update` command takes skill names positionally.

### `gh skill`

`gh skill` is available in GitHub CLI v2.90.0+ and is currently in public preview.

Preview a skill before installing it:

```bash
gh skill preview kong/skills gateway-plugin-datakit
```

```bash
gh skill install kong/skills
```

If you want to install the single skill in this repo directly, use:

```bash
gh skill install kong/skills gateway-plugin-datakit
```

If `gh skill` does not pick the right host automatically, pass `--agent`.

Pin an install to a reviewed tag or SHA when you need reproducibility:

```bash
gh skill install kong/skills gateway-plugin-datakit --pin v1.0.0
```

Update all installed skills:

```bash
gh skill update --all
```

Update one installed skill:

```bash
gh skill update gateway-plugin-datakit
```

These skill-only installs do not require `KONNECT_TOKEN`.

If you maintain this skills repo, validate GitHub-side publishability without publishing:

```bash
gh skill publish --dry-run
```

## Auto-Update Caution

Be careful with any automatic update path. It can pull newer skill instructions without review, which may introduce supply-chain or security risk if content changes upstream.

If you use auto-update, prefer updating one known skill first:

```bash
npx skills update -g -y gateway-plugin-datakit
```

Or with GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh skill update gateway-plugin-datakit
```

Claude Code and Gemini CLI both have native update flows. See their install pages for the current recommended approach.

## MCP Config Reference

Use one of these as the source of truth for the `kong-konnect` MCP server:

- [`.mcp.json`](../../.mcp.json)
- [cursor-mcp.json](../../cursor-mcp.json)
- [`gemini-extension.json`](../../gemini-extension.json)

`KONNECT_TOKEN` is only required if you add and use the MCP server.
